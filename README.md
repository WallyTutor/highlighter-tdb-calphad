# Thermodynamic database (CALPHAD) Syntax Highlighter

Basic syntax highlighting for thermodynamic database (CALPHAD) macros created with [Yeoman generator tool](https://yeoman.io/).

**NOTE:** this is minimal version. If you want full support, please consider the official Thermo-Calc equivalent package.

## Installation instructions

Simply copy the directory [tdb](tdb/) to your VS Code extensions directory.

Under most Linux distributions this can be done with a simple:

```bash
cp -avr $(pwd)/tdb/ ${HOME}/.vscode/extensions/

# or for development just link symbolically.
ln -s $(pwd)/tdb/ ${HOME}/.vscode/extensions/
```

For Windows users, you should have a directory called `.vscode` in your user profile.
